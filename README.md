## Description

This project, developed as part of a Mission Ready course, demonstrates a responsive website design concept for a hypothetical website. It focuses on utilizing modern front-end techniques to achieve responsiveness and dynamic styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Leveraged `clamps` and employed `media queries` for adapting layouts across different screen sizes.
- **Navbar:** Implemented a collapsing navbar that transitions to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Utilized `CSS variables` and `color-mix` for dynamic and customizable color blending.
